        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 2 }}>
        As a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science department, 
        I lead introductory courses in Python and Java, catering to 
        an average class size of 150 undergraduate students. My

        challenge and enhance the students' understanding and skills 
        in programming.

        In addition to my teaching duties, I provide personalized 
        guidance to students regarding their academic journeys and 
        career prospects within the computer science field. I work 
        closely with individuals to map out their graduation paths,

          Assistant Manager
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 2 }}>
        At the age of 17, I stepped into a leadership role 
        as an Assistant Manager at Dion's Pizza. This position proved to 
        be an opportunity far exceeding my expectations in 
        terms of skill and experience development. In my managerial capacity, 
        I oversaw the entire food preparation process within the restaurant, 
        ensuring that every dish met our high standards for quality and safety.

        My responsibilities extended beyond kitchen management; I monitored and 
        enforced stringent food safety protocols to maintain health standards. 
        Managing the restaurant staff, I was actively involved in training new 
        employees on everything from our specific culinary techniques, to the 
        effective cleaning procedures. Customer service was a key focus, and 
        I coached my team to deliver outstanding service that matched the quality 
        of our food.

        Additionally, I was tasked with task delegation, optimizing both time and 
        financial management to enhance store operations and profitability. My role 
        required a balanced approach to leadership, emphasizing efficiency, safety, 
        and customer satisfactionâ€”all of which were critical in maintaining the 
        esteemed reputation of Dion's Pizza.

          Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Design courses

        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2, mb: 2 }}>
          The Software Engineering and Object-Oriented Design courses at Colorado 
          State University are both designed after the workplace. Both courses 
          are team based with the goal of your team developing a website within 
          the semester. The courses taught Reactjs, Java, HTML, and CSS for coding the site.
          The courses also taught Scrum and Agile development for team design.
          Both courses taught me a lot about teamwork, and Software Development
          far beyond any of my other courses. These courses are a defining point
          in my programming career that I'll always hold close to my heart.
